# GIFTastic

Deployed Page: https://thomwint.github.io/GIFTastic/

This app uses the Giphy API - there are set buttons and you can add buttons to the top of the page. Each button will then make a call to the API and present you with 10 gifs that you can start and stop any time you wish.

I used the Giphy API and Jquery to manipulate the DOM to have the gifs appear after a button is selected. Each button can be created by the user and then the button is given the attributes of creating the gifs from the promise of Giphy.

I approached and solved this by understanding how the Giphy API works (using their documentation) and then used my knowledge of DOM manipulation to show the results from the user's choice.
